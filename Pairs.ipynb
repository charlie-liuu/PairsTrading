    "1. We aim to create a model which tests for correlation between the basket of securities for stationary pairs\n",
    "2. We then test for cointegration, which is a test between two time series to whether they will deviate approximating a relative mean\n",
    "    - To do so, we can use the <b>Engleâ€“Granger</b> two-step method to test for cointegration\n",
    "    - We can also use the <b>Johansen</b> test to check for cointegration between the two time series\n",
    "3. We also need to test for stationarity of the time series, whether the time series have variances or means which changes over time\n",
    "    - Examples of these could be stochastic processes such as random walk time series, or trend/cycle time series\n",
    "    - We can test for stationarity using the <b>Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test</b>\n"
